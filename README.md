This program demonstrates object-oriented JavaScript with kids in a playground. They are playing with a ball that has
the attributes of size, color, type, and action. 

You can instantiate a ball with <code>var soccer = new Ball(type, color, size, action)</code>

Print your program with <code>console.log( soccer.toString() );</code>

It then concatinates into a cute little sentence like "The children are kicking the soccerball. It is big and orange."
